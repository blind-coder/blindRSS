Installation should be quite simple:

Put the complete extracted directory where your webserver can find it. Your webserver must support PHP.
Create a database and run the SQL file DATABASELAYOUT.sql on it.
Copy etc/config.example.php to etc/config.php and edit to match the database.
Create a cronjob that runs the file blindrss.php every once in a while.
To run it every 15 minutes, it could look like this:

*/15 * * * * php /var/www/blindrss/blindrss.php

Open the index.html in your javascript-capable webbrowser.
Enjoy!
